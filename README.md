   Caretaking of a parent does not come naturally to most of us.  There is an inevitable reversal of roles when a parent or other beloved elder begins to demonstrate cognitive decline. For most, it requires a giant leap toward accepting the reality of this new relationship dynamic. This guide is designed to help family members understand the responsibilities that come with this new role.

**Early Warning Signs**

Very often changes in an older adultâ€™s cognitive abilities are first observed at an annual family gathering such as a family celebration or holiday meal.  It is not uncommon for children to tell themselves that they are overreacting or imagining slight changes in their older loved one, but when changes are noticed by several family members, or are noticed over several different occasions, it is time to pay close attention and to begin a conversation about these concerns.  
Cognitive decline becomes more common as individuals age.  Some cognitive decline is normal beginning as early as age 50, but when changes in memory, mood, behavior or routine become frequent to the point that they are impacting daily life, it is time to address these concerns.  Family members may not want to be alarmist, and indeed, families should try to avoid overdramatizing normal decline in memory.  Repeating a story that was told at another time to the same listeners is not unusual in normal aging, but when repetitiveness occurs frequently in the same conversation there is cause for concern.  Getting lost or confused while driving is another red flag that indicates a major change in routine and behavior.

*Cause for Concern*
1. Social differences.  Dementia can cause people to significantly decrease or avoid social interaction. Take note of any changes in conduct and conversations that point to a preference for isolation. 
2. Mood shifts. Depression, anxiety and unfounded imaginings are commonly present in dementia patients. These changes in behavior are cause for concern.
3. Memory loss. Difficulties with short-term memory can be common in older adults. Repeating conversation snippets several times in a single conversation is a red flag.
4. Problems with changing routines. A person affected by dementia may have great difficulty with simple changes to their daily routine. 
5. Personal hygiene. Having difficulty keeping up basic personal cleanliness and grooming are cause for concern.
6. Housekeeping.  Although housekeeping often becomes less of a priority for older people, some things are not typical and should be noted.  These might include: forgetting to empty garbage cans, clean kitty litter boxes, neglecting to do laundry or keeping spoiled food in the refrigerator.  

**Next Steps**
You and other family members have observed several of the *early warning signs* and *causes for concern* in your loved one. Now what? This is one of the most difficult decisions to make.  Approaching Mom or Dad with concern over failing cognitive ability is sure to raise a host of conflicted emotions.  You and other concerned family members may feel discomfort, even fear at approaching your elder with your concerns.  Indeed, most seniors will feel pride, fear, and an unwillingness to accept that they are aging.  They may refuse to see a doctor for evaluation.  This is not unusual, but this is where persistence pays off.  If after many attempts to encourage a visit to the doctor, your loved one still refuses, then a family meeting is in order. 

A family meeting provides the opportunity to share your concerns with your loved one.  It also allows your loved one to express their fears and wishes for their future. in the best of circumstances, it allows all concerned to collaborate on a plan of action.  The first step should be an agreement for a medical evaluation.  A family meeting might include: adult children, very close family friends or other close relatives, and perhaps a member of the clergy.

A doctor's input can be helpful. Elders often place a good deal of trust in their doctors and may take their direction seriously. If your loved one has agreed to have an assessment of their cognitive ability, this is a step in the right direction.  If your loved one refuses to see a medical professional, don't give up.  Keep encouraging them.  Reach out to their medical team with your concerns. Eventually, they will have a routine medical visit come up.  If the medical personnel have been alerted to your concerns, they will find a way to work an evaluation into a routine visit.  

**Keeping the Person with Dementia Safe at Home**
A diagnosis of dementia has been made. Of course, this has, most likely, been a shock to both you and your loved one.  Now what? Is it possible for a person diagnosed with dementia to remain in their home?  The answer is a resounding "yes" - at least for a while.
Now that your loved one and concerned family or friends understand the cognitive difficulties that your loved one is facing, a decision may be made for him/her to remain in the home for as long as possible. With support, many people can remain in their homes.  
The following are ways to provide a safe in-home support system.
*Neighbors* Leave a set of house keys with a trusted neighbor.	Make sure there is access to the home, and someone can enter the home if a problem arises.
*Phone Check-ins* Arrange for someone to call or visit your loved one daily.	
*Purchase a medical alert system*  Consider one that is wearable.  Research the service that is the best fit for your loved one's needs.
*Appliance safety* Consider upgrading appliances to those that have automatic shut off.  Tea kettles, coffee makers, even 
stove tops can be installed with automatic shut off timers.  Remove fuses in the oven and shut off the gas.

Provide toaster oven or microwave for heating food.	Preparation is easier.
