   Caretaking of a parent does not come naturally to most of us.  There is an inevitable reversal of roles when a parent or other beloved elder begins to demonstrate cognitive decline. For most, it requires a giant leap toward accepting the reality of this new relationship dynamic. This guide is designed to help family members understand the responsibilities that come with this new role.

**Early Warning Signs**

Very often changes in an older adultâ€™s cognitive abilities are first observed at an annual family gathering such as a family celebration or holiday meal.  It is not uncommon for children to tell themselves that they are overreacting or imagining slight changes in their older loved one, but when changes are noticed by several family members, or are noticed over several different occasions, it is time to pay close attention and to begin a conversation about these concerns.  
Cognitive decline becomes more common as individuals age.  Some cognitive decline is normal beginning as early as age 50, but when changes in memory, mood, behavior or routine become frequent to the point that they are impacting daily life, it is time to address these concerns.  Family members may not want to be alarmist, and indeed, families should try to avoid overdramatizing normal decline in memory.  Repeating a story that was told at another time to the same listeners is not unusual in normal aging, but when repetitiveness occurs frequently in the same conversation there is cause for concern.  Getting lost or confused while driving is another red flag that indicates a major change in routine and behavior.

*Cause for Concern*
1. Social differences.  Dementia can cause people to significantly decrease or avoid social interaction. Take note of any changes in conduct and conversations that point to a preference for isolation. 
2. Mood shifts. Depression, anxiety and unfounded imaginings are commonly present in dementia patients. These changes in behavior are cause for concern.
3. Memory loss. Difficulties with short-term memory can be common in older adults. Repeating conversation snippets several times in a single conversation is a red flag.
4. Problems with changing routines. A person affected by dementia may have great difficulty with simple changes to their daily routine. 
5. Personal hygiene. Having difficulty keeping up basic personal cleanliness and grooming are cause for concern.
6. Housekeeping.  Although housekeeping often becomes less of a priority for older people, some things are not typical and should be noted.  These might include: forgetting to empty garbage cans, clean kitty litter boxes, neglecting to do laundry or keeping spoiled food in the refrigerator.  

**Next Steps**
Work with your parents on this. Trusts, wills, durable powers of attorney and health care directives are the most important ones you need to review.  It might have been years since anyone looked them over.  Urge your parent to see an estate planning attorney.  Tax laws change, state laws can vary. Some aging parents have never actually gotten the necessary legal papers together.  The time may come when Dad is no longer competent to sign anything. Waiting until "the right time" is not good strategy.  It can be too late before you know it.

Plan ahead for Dad's possible care needs.

Who would look after him if Mom could no longer do this?  He may go downhill in the future.   If he does have dementia, it won't remain the same over time.  People get more dependent on help with their daily needs.  Help is not free.  Some source of payment for help with daily care should be in the plan.

Discuss Dad's situation with all family members.

Call a family meeting. If Dad has memory problems now, everyone in the family will eventually be involved in the situation.  Siblings may need to share caregiving duties.  Some may need to make financial contributions.  Taking care of both parents as they age is no longer rare.  An honest conversation about who can do what, and who is willing to help aging parents can go a long way toward avoiding resentment and conflict later on.  Take the first step. Be the leader. Someone has to do this, and it isn't always an aging parent.

You don't want to be the one lulled into a false sense of security because no one has officially diagnosed your aging parent with a specific kind of dementia.  It doesn't matter. Trust your own eyes and ears.  If your gut tells you there's something wrong here with your loved one, there probably is something wrong.  Jaclyn already knows something is brewing with her Dad. She's being proactive and I applaud her.

You're not alone if you have a parent with memory loss. Millions of people are facing this every day. They find a way to manage it, and survive and you will too.  Be smart.  Look down the road. Stand tall and do this last part of being a grown child of your parent. Take the basic steps to protect your aging parent and yourself and you will get through it without unnecessary stress.
