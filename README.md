   Caretaking of a parent does not come naturally to most of us.  There is an inevitable reversal of roles when a parent or other beloved elder begins to demonstrate cognitive decline. For most, it requires a giant leap toward accepting the reality of this new relationship dynamic. This guide is designed to help family members understand the responsibilities that come with this new role.

**Early Warning Signs**

Very often changes in an older adultâ€™s cognitive abilities are first observed at an annual family gathering such as a family celebration or holiday meal.  It is not uncommon for children to tell themselves that they are overreacting or imagining slight changes in their older loved one, but when changes are noticed by several family members, or are noticed over several different occasions, it is time to pay close attention and to begin a conversation about these concerns.  
Cognitive decline becomes more common as individuals age.  Some cognitive decline is normal beginning as early as age 50, but when changes in memory, mood, behavior or routine become frequent to the point that they are impacting daily life, it is time to address these concerns.  Family members may not want to be alarmist, and indeed, families should try to avoid overdramatizing normal decline in memory.  Repeating a story that was told at another time to the same listeners is not unusual in normal aging, but when repetitiveness occurs frequently in the same conversation there is cause for concern.  Getting lost or confused while driving is another red flag that indicates a major change in routine and behavior.

*Cause for Concern*
1. Social differences.  Dementia can cause people to significantly decrease or avoid social interaction. Take note of any changes in conduct and conversations that point to a preference for isolation. 
2. Mood shifts. Depression, anxiety and unfounded imaginings are commonly present in dementia patients. These changes in behavior are cause for concern.
3. Memory loss. Difficulties with short-term memory can be common in older adults. Repeating conversation snippets several times in a single conversation is a red flag.
4. Problems with changing routines. A person affected by dementia may have great difficulty with simple changes to their daily routine. 
5. Personal hygiene. Having difficulty keeping up basic personal cleanliness and grooming are cause for concern.
6. Housekeeping.  Although housekeeping often becomes less of a priority for older people, some things are not typical and should be noted.  These might include: forgetting to empty garbage cans, clean kitty litter boxes, neglecting to do laundry or keeping spoiled food in the refrigerator.  

**Next Steps**
Pride, fear, unwillingness to accept the realities of aging, and extreme discomfort with change are some of the reasons. At AgingParents.com, we see scenarios like this quite often. Here are some of the approaches we suggest.

If feasible, we always encourage a family meeting, including not only adult children, but caring others as well. A best friend may hold more sway in convincing a stubborn parent to think about safety than "the kids." (What do they know anyway?) Clergy, or someone the aging parent looks up to and respects, can be invaluable in persuading a change of heart.

A doctor's input can be quite helpful. Our elders may trust and believe their doctors and take their direction seriously. We encourage asking the doctor to see the aging parent and to strongly advise a move or other step the parent can take to reduce the risk of living alone.

As responsible adult children, we can check out suitable alternative living situations in advance and ask the aging parent to visit with us. "Just have lunch and see the place" is a first step. Most such facilities will gladly serve you lunch and show you around, introducing an aging parent to other residents.

Marketing directors at assisted living facilities can be useful in helping an aging parent with the often difficult transition. However, beware of the sales pitch. They want to match the facility to the prospect, but there can be tremendous pressure on them to fill empty apartments. It is important to understand the legal limits of assisted living. Know them if you are considering it as an option for your parent.

When our parents resist our help and refuse all suggestions, as some do, we can't force them. The exception is when an aging parent is truly a danger to himself or herself and legal means to protect the parent become necessary.

Guardianship (also called conservatorship in California), while the ultimate protection against self-neglect, is an extreme step and should only be taken with the advice of an experienced elder law attorney. I consider it a sad last resort. It may be necessary, but it may carry a large emotional and financial price tag.

Short of guardianship, we must remember the simple truth: There's no law against adults (even aging ones) making stupid decisions. As responsible and caring family members, we have to try our best to get our parents to look out for their own safety and well-being and to overcome their fears and resistance to change.

Persistence can pay off. Aging parents may eventually realize that it's time to give up. Let's hope it doesn't take a broken neck to get there. Our ongoing encouragement and respectful, patient offers of help may be heeded over time.

Work with your parents on this. Trusts, wills, durable powers of attorney and health care directives are the most important ones you need to review.  It might have been years since anyone looked them over.  Urge your parent to see an estate planning attorney.  Tax laws change, state laws can vary. Some aging parents have never actually gotten the necessary legal papers together.  The time may come when Dad is no longer competent to sign anything. Waiting until "the right time" is not good strategy.  It can be too late before you know it.

Plan ahead for Dad's possible care needs.

Who would look after him if Mom could no longer do this?  He may go downhill in the future.   If he does have dementia, it won't remain the same over time.  People get more dependent on help with their daily needs.  Help is not free.  Some source of payment for help with daily care should be in the plan.

Discuss Dad's situation with all family members.

Call a family meeting. If Dad has memory problems now, everyone in the family will eventually be involved in the situation.  Siblings may need to share caregiving duties.  Some may need to make financial contributions.  Taking care of both parents as they age is no longer rare.  An honest conversation about who can do what, and who is willing to help aging parents can go a long way toward avoiding resentment and conflict later on.  Take the first step. Be the leader. Someone has to do this, and it isn't always an aging parent.

You don't want to be the one lulled into a false sense of security because no one has officially diagnosed your aging parent with a specific kind of dementia.  It doesn't matter. Trust your own eyes and ears.  If your gut tells you there's something wrong here with your loved one, there probably is something wrong.  Jaclyn already knows something is brewing with her Dad. She's being proactive and I applaud her.

You're not alone if you have a parent with memory loss. Millions of people are facing this every day. They find a way to manage it, and survive and you will too.  Be smart.  Look down the road. Stand tall and do this last part of being a grown child of your parent. Take the basic steps to protect your aging parent and yourself and you will get through it without unnecessary stress.
