   Caretaking of a parent does not come naturally to most of us.  There is an inevitable reversal of roles when a parent or other beloved elder begins to demonstrate cognitive decline. For most, it requires a giant leap toward accepting the reality of this new relationship dynamic. This guide is designed to help family members understand the responsibilities that come with this new role.

**Early Warning Signs**

Very often changes in an older adult’s cognitive abilities are first observed at an annual family gathering such as a family celebration or holiday meal.  It is not uncommon for children to tell themselves that they are overreacting or imagining slight changes in their older loved one, but when changes are noticed by several family members, or are noticed over several different occasions, it is time to pay close attention and to begin a conversation about these concerns.  
Cognitive decline becomes more common as individuals age.  Some cognitive decline is normal beginning as early as age 50, but when changes in memory, mood, behavior or routine become frequent to the point that they are impacting daily life, it is time to address these concerns.  Family members may not want to be alarmist, and indeed, families should try to avoid overdramatizing normal decline in memory.  Repeating a story that was told at another time to the same listeners is not unusual in normal aging, but when repetitiveness occurs frequently in the same conversation there is cause for concern.  Getting lost or confused while driving is another red flag that indicates a major change in routine and behavior.

*Cause for Concern*
1. Social differences.  Dementia can cause people to become closed-off, avoiding any sense of social interaction. Take note of any changes in conduct and conversations that point to a preference for isolation. This is especially true if the individual has always enjoyed social interacation.
2. Mood shifts. Depression, anxiety, and apathy are common aspects of dementia. The illness has an effect on a person’s ability to process and overcome emotions, often caused by the inability to remember what triggered an adverse emotion, leading to increased aggravation.
3. Memory loss. Difficulties with memory are at the heart of Alzheimer’s disease, specifically, short-term memory. Note whether or not the senior appears to have a problem with present-day occurrences, but is able to fully be involved in conversations about the past.
4. Problems with re-structured routines. Recognizing a sense of disorientation, anxiety or agitation is common through the holiday season, with its probability of disruptions to the usual routine. Individuals with Alzheimer’s have a tendency to depend greatly on familiarity and will seem out of sorts when deviating from the usual.
5. Physical changes. Note any evidence of a decrease in hygiene or in the cleanliness and organization of the house, especially if the senior has until now been thorough in keeping a sense of order.
Any worries such as these should be brought to the attention of the senior’s primary care physician as quickly as possible.
